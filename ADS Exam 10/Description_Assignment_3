Description
In this assignment you will implement a hash set that uses separate chaining. You are expected to implement the following methods:

void add(String key)

The method add takes as input a string key and adds this key to the set. If key is null, nothing should happen.
This method must run in (1)
 time.
void remove(String key)

The method remove takes as input one string key and removes it from the set.
This method must run in (1)
 time.
boolean contains(String key)

The method contains takes as input one string key and returns true if it is in the set, and false otherwise.
This method must run in (1)
 time.
IMPORTANT:

Your implementation of these methods should not allow null to be used as a key.
You are not allowed to add or modify fields for the class. Adding extra methods is allowed (note: these should not be static).
You are not allowed to use other data structures other than the given ones.
If your implementation does not adhere to the requirements, or if you have cheated the spec test system in any way, points may be deducted.
