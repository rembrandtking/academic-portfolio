# 🧠 Algorithms & Data Structures – Resit Exam Solutions (10/10 Grade)

This repository contains my solutions for the resit implementation exam of **CSE1305 – Algorithms & Data Structures** at TU Delft.

🟢 **Grade received:** 10/10  
📍 **Environment:** Java 17, WebLab (TU Delft exam platform)  
⏱️ **Duration:** 2-hour timed implementation exam

The exam required solving multiple algorithmic problems involving data structures like trees, linked lists, recursion, and sorting under strict time constraints. Code was graded both automatically (via spec tests) and manually.

> ❗️Note: This repository contains post-exam reconstructions and cleaned-up versions of my solutions. The original exam code was submitted directly in WebLab and cannot be retrieved.
